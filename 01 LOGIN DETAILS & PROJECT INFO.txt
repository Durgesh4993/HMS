**Hospital Management System**
A fully functional project based on Online Hospital Management System Project which uses PHP Language with MySQL Database. In particular, this Hospital Management System Project in PHP focuses mainly on managing medical-related records within the hospital. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of medical reports. Also, the system displays all the available employees and patients. In addition, the system allows adding up inventories, and pharmacy records too(codeastro.com). Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with an employee/doctor panel. In an overview of this web application, a doctor can simply log into the system using his/her doctor id and password. He/she can manage patients, pharmacy, and laboratory records. Additionally, the employee/doctor can view and manage inventories too. With it, the system also allows the user to view detailed information and reports of each patient. Besides, the users can update their profiles too.

**Admin Panel**
An admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage patients, employees, accounting, and so on. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, and other important details. Here, an admin can add patient records directly by filling up the required forms. During the patient registration, an admin has to provide details such as name, address, contact, age with patient type, and ailment. With it, the administrator can also manage staff members for the system(codeastro.com). For adding an employee/doctor, the user has to provide names and set up login credentials. Here, each and every employee will have their own unique id. Which is automatically created by the system during the registration process. Talking about the patient management section, the system users can also manage patient transfer and discharge records.

**Employee Management**
As mentioned earlier, the administrator can add a number of employee/doctor records with their own login credentials. Besides, there are certain features that need to be discussed in this section. Here is the list of features and rules that are worth mentioning under this section. Each employee member needs to fall under a certain department. In short, the admin must assign departments to each employee member after their registration process. By default, it’s set to none. With it, there’s also another feature that’ll let the user change their department [if needed]. In order to change a department, the admin has to proceed through the transfer employee phase. There the system allows an admin to change the department from a current one to a new one (codeastro.com). Some of the available departments are Pharmacy, Accounting, Surgery, and more. FYI, the selection of the Surgery department assigns an employee as a doctor.


**Pharmacy Management**
When it comes to projects such as the Hospital system, it’s a must that it should contain a section to cover pharmacy records too. And there is one. For this online hospital management system project, the administrator can manage pharmacy records easily. Not just with ease, but also it helps to cover up all the important and required information for the system. The administrator has to add the pharmaceutical category first before anything. Then, the admin can provide a number of pharmacy records. For that, the user has to provide details such as name, quantity, category, vendor, barcode, and description. Here, each and every medicine item will have its own unique barcode(codeastro.com). Which is automatically created by the system while inserting a new record. Besides, the administrator can update and delete these items as well as categories. And the same access level goes for the employee members too.
Besides adding up medicine records and categories, the admin can also simply add and manage prescriptions for each patient. For this, the admin has to select any from the available patient list and type it into the list of prescriptions. In fact, this portion is mostly handled or mostly meant to be handled by the staff members. But still, the admin has a high ground on any of these sections as well as the system. Also, all the prescriptions can be updated and removed anytime by employee members too.

**Accounting Section and Inventory Management**
Moreover, an admin only has the access to manage the accounting system for the hospital(codeastro.com). Under the accounting section, it includes payable and receivable accounts. In order to add a payable account, an admin has to provide the account name and amount with a description. And the same process goes in terms of receivable accounts too. Managing these sections helps the system administrator to check up on their pending accounts and the flow of transactions. Moving toward the other side, Inventory management consists of two sections. One is pharmaceuticals and the other one is assets. The Pharmaceuticals section lists all the available medical records whereas the assets section lists the hospital’s assets. In fact, the assets can only be managed by the system administrator. The assets records contain details such as equipment name, code, vendor, department, and quantity.

**Reporting and Medical Records**
Talking about the reporting section contains all the overall records of the system. Such as InPatient records, OutPatient records, as well as records of employees, pharmacy, accounting, and medical. And all these sections have already been discussed above with the proper heading for each. So, moving on to the next section is related to medical records. This one’s a simple feature that has also been discussed earlier under a different topic. Which in fact is going to be repeated once again for your kind information. Remember the prescription management section? (codeastro.com) Yes, and that exactly falls under this medical records section too. As the administrator can manage a tip of medical records by providing prescriptions. This is not just only thing that falls under medical records, there are other things too that’ll be discussed in the next paragraph.

**Laboratory Section**
The laboratory section is where all the important patient’s medical records and held and managed. Under the laboratory section, the administrator can add and manage patients’ lab tests. Following it, the user can also add and manage (codeastro.com) the patient as well as the employee’s vitals. In order to capture the user’s vitals, the admin has to provide details such as body temperature in Celcius, heart pulse/beat bpm, respiratory rate bpm, and blood pressure mmHg. An admin can view lab results and reports for each available patient. In fact, all these reports are set under each employee and patient’s profile under their respective tabs. Which can be viewed anytime by the users. Besides, the system administrator can also manage lab equipment. FYI, lab equipment is directly connected to assets management.

Surgical Theatre Section**
Similarly, this section also helps in the management of assets by allowing the administrator to add and manage required equipment. The next section is related to surgery records and patients. This particular section holds up a patient’s record that requires surgery. For this, the admin has to manually select and add patients to it. Adding a patient to a surgery list is very simple(codeastro.com). All you have to do is select the name of the available surgeon and that’s it. By default, the surgery status is set to ongoing which can later be changed through the manage section. The users can view surgery records which display information that includes the patient’s name, number, ailment, surgery date, name of the surgeon, and status.

**Payroll Management and Vendors**
On one hand, this project also includes a payroll management system for the employee members. The rules out here are pretty simple or might be kind of tricky for some, but still effective in ways. The very first step of payroll management is to add payroll details. Meaning, the admin has to select any of the available employees and provide salary details. Speaking of salary details refers to salary amount and description. Completion of this process means the employee is eligible for the payroll process. And here comes the interesting one. The second step or the final one is to generate payroll (codeastro.com). In fact, everything is auto-generated by the system after adding up payroll details. The user just has to click on generate payroll button and view the payroll receipt. Also, the user can print out the payroll receipt.
Talking about the Vendors section, the administrator can add and manage vendors. For adding a vendor’s information, the user has to provide certain details. That includes the name of the vendor along with the vendor’s address, number, email, and other details. This particular section is directly connected with the pharmacy section while adding medicine records and categories.

**Doctor’s Panel**
On the other hand, the user has full access level regarding the patient’s section. And just like that, the user can also manage pharmacy records as well as inventories and laboratory reports. Even though the features are a bit limited to the employee/doctors, the selected ones are important that plays a vital role in maintaining the system. Not to get confused by the term employee management with a doctor as both of them are kind of the same for the system. The only thing that differentiates them is their assigned department. The other department’s employees as well as doctors can capture and set vitals and other lab reports of the patient (codeastro.com). Besides all of these, the employee members can view their respective payroll reports from the payroll section. Additionally, the payroll receipt contains tax information and extra notes too.

In addition to it, the employees can also view their profiles and update them. Last but not least, a clean and simple dashboard is presented with various color combinations for a greater user experience while using this Online Hospital Management System Project in PHP MySQL. For its UI elements, a free open-source CSS framework; Bootstrap is on board with some Vanilla CSS too. Presenting a new Hospital Management System Project in PHP MySQL which includes an admin panel with an employee panel. That too contains all the essential features to follow up and is a knowledgeable resource for learning purposes.
