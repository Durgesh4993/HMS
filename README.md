### Hospital Management System

A fully functional project based on Online Hospital Management System Project which uses PHP Language with MySQL Database. In particular, this Hospital Management System Project in PHP focuses mainly on managing medical-related records within the hospital. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of medical reports. Also, the system displays all the available employees and patients. In addition, the system allows adding up inventories, and pharmacy records too(codeastro.com). Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with an employee/doctor panel. In an overview of this web application, a doctor can simply log into the system using his/her doctor id and password. He/she can manage patients, pharmacy, and laboratory records. Additionally, the employee/doctor can view and manage inventories too. With it, the system also allows the user to view detailed information and reports of each patient. Besides, the users can update their profiles too.
